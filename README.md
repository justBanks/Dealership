# Car Dealership Inventory
ASP.NET Core 2.2 + OAuth2 sample 

- **Domain:** Car Dealership
- **Interface:** Web API
- **Front end:** ASP.NET Core MVC

## OAuth2

The OAuth implementation demonstrates the full redirect flow for obtaining an access token. The user must first authenticate with the authorization server, then grant the application permission to act on the user's behalf. This implementation was chosen because I deem it to be most appropriate for JavaScript and mobile clients.

**Login credentials >> test-user:test**
